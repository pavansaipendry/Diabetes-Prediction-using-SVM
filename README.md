# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM
This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health indicators. The data is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and used to train the SVM model, which is then evaluated for accuracy.

To run this project, you need Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using:
`pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn`

## Project Structure
The notebook follows these main steps:

- **Importing Dependencies**: Imports necessary libraries like numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares the data for training, including scaling features and splitting into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model using the test set to determine accuracy.
- **Prediction**: Uses the trained model to make predictions on new data samples.


## Dataset

## Results
The SVM model achieves satisfactory accuracy in predicting diabetes. Accuracy metrics and evaluation results are displayed in the notebook's output section.
